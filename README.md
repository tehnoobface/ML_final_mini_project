# Machine Learning Final Project: BBC Document full text Classification

## Project Description:

### Introduction: Question Formulation and Data Acquisition

This repository contains a dataset of BBC published documents, a README.md file, and a Python Notebook containing exploratoy data analysis, model selection, model prediction, and model interpretation. This repository is where I will be testing various models on the BBC data, in an attempt to discover which machine learning model works best for large text dataset classification. This dataset is legal to use, and can be found through Kaggle [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alfathterry/bbc-full-text-document-classification/data)

The goal for this project is to determine the effectiveness of machine learning models at classification when trained on a large dataset. Text classification can be done in a variety of ways, and this project will be discovering which model seems to be the best at classification when trained on this large dataset, which contains 2,226 articles published by the BBC. The model "best at classification" will be determined by a number of factors including model accuracy, precision, and recall, as well as the time it takes to train and make predictions on the data.
